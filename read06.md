# what Makes a Computer, a Computer?

the 4 things common to all computers
# 1-inputs  # 2-storge # 3-processing # 4-output
in the 20th start using electrical component but the was so big
and so slow
a big like a room size and takes a hour to solve a basic math problem

# input
every thing tell the computer to do something like mouse camera and els

# storage
all the input goes to the pc storage then
the pc prosccer take all the input from it and make changes on it by the
(algorithm)=>a series of commands then it's send the procses agian to the
storage tell the output

# the output
can be on the screen like photo or txt .games and a lot

and it's not just the pc that we all now
the cars and the robot's and machine have a pc the are different but all of them have the same
cycle


# The binary system
it's use the 1 and 0 just
and any number can present with these tow number


with 32 wires can store from 0 to 4 billion

also the text made by number

the videos are made of pixels
the sound every sound is wave and every wave can be present on the sound waveform that later can be presented by numbers

 


# Circuits is million of tiny electronic component

# logi gates : 1-and 2-nand 3-not 4- nor -5 or 6-xor
the adder can take 2 logic gate

the cpu is the master chip that controls all the other part of the computer

# operating system :
the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of computer


it's really all about 1-inputs 2-storge 3-processing 4-output
